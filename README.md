AirPollution Tracker is a React capstone project that serves as a mobile web application, connected to a powerful Air Pollution API. It provides real-time, forecast, and historical air pollution data for any location on the globe. The app displays Air Quality Index and key polluting gases (CO, NO, NO2, O3, SO2, NH3, PM2.5, PM10).
